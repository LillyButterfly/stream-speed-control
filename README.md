## üìö Introduction

**Stream Speed Control** is an ongoing project created for educational purposes and is open to contributions from the community.

The objective of this tool was to investigate the process of creating an extension and to meet the need to accelerate videos on streaming services that do not have this function natively.

As it involves many interesting concepts and can add a lot to practical experience, I invite the entire beginner (or not) community to collaborate and improve this project.

I hope to learn a lot from everyone!!
